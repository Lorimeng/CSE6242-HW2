1. Ease to develop for developers
    D3: a programming library for data visualization, which is not easy as excel and Tableau to develop, because user needs to learn JavaScript programming language.
    Tableau and Excel: a tool for data visualization. Do not need to learn programming language, and they are more intuitive for developers.
2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers
    D3: 
    Tableau: 
    Excel: 
3. Usability of visualization developed for end users
    D3: D3 is good at usability, because d3 is a library specified for visualization. 
    Tableau: 
    Excel: not good as D3, 
4. Scalability of visualization to "large" datasets
    D3: good at visualizing large datasets, only need to write code to parde data
    Tableau: large dataset is hard for user to visualize, because there are so much rows and columns. 
    Excel: the same as Tableau
5. System requirement to run the visualization for end users
    D3: need D3 library downloaded or need wifi to access D3 library, and need dataset file
    Tableau: Need Tableau software, and is not popular as excel, only need dataset file.
